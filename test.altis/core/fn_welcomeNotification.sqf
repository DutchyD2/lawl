	"Welcome to the ENDZONE server! ",
	"Rule #1; Don't be a GIT. Use common sense and follow the rules given to you.",
	"If you want to report bugs/glitches, feel free to do so at ContactDutchy@gmail.com, you'll recieve a money reward if the glitch hasn't been reported before",
	"Rules can be found at http://www.endzonenetwork.com/rules",
	"We do not accept donations. We feel that donations are a way for servers to abuse their players by forcing them to pay for the highest tiers of weapons and clothes",
	"No police training, instead we'll be keeping a close eye on all the police to see if they're fit for a promotion.",
	"WORK IN PROGRESS - We are still working on the server, things are changing on almost a daily basis, so we can see what fits best for our community",
	"Use your windows key to interact with people, vehicles and buildings.",
	"If you are having issues with interacting / picking up items just wait. A quick way to know when you can interact with that item if the server allows it is by pressing your tilde key (~) and using the circle to highlight the object, when it says for example 'Pile of Money' then
	that means you can pick it up!."
